## Edgex Docker Compose (Odessa)

This branch contains the docker compose files that pull and run the ** EdgeX Odessa** release images.

These compose files are auto generated from the multiple files contained in the `compose-builder` folder.
See Compose Builder [README](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-compose/blob/odessa/compose-builder/README.md) for details.

### Compose Tool

The Makefile in this folder expects the `docker compose` CLI command.
The old stand-alone `docker-compose` tool is no longer supported.
See https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ for installation details for the latest `docker compose` CLI command.

### Compose Files

This folder contains the following compose files:

#### Generated Compose files

> **Note to Developers: **
>
> - *DO NOT EDIT the files directly for permanent changes. Make all permanent changes to the source compose files in the `compose-builder` folder and then regenerate these files*
> - Use `make build` from **Compose Builder** to regenerate all the following compose files.
> - See each description for the convenience `make` commands that are provided to work with each of these compose files.

- **docker-compose.yml**
    Contains all the services required to run in secure configuration. Includes the Device Virtual & Device REST device services and the UI.
    **Make Commands** 
    
     - Use `make run <service(s)>` and `make down` to start and stop the services using this compose file.
    
     - Use `make pull <service(s)>` to pull all or some images for the services in this compose file.
    
     - Use `make get-token` to generate a proxy access token for remote access of the services running from this compose file.

- **docker-compose-with-app-sample.yml**
    Contains all the services required to run in secure configuration with Sample application service.  Includes the Device Virtual, Device REST, UI & App Sample services. Use this version when using the UI to make changes to the configurable pipeline on the Sample application service.
    **Make Commands**

    - Use `make run app-sample` and `make down` to start and stop the services using this compose file.
    - Use `make pull app-sample <service(s)>` to pull all or some images for the services in this compose file.

- **docker-compose-no-secty.yml**
    Contains just the services needed to run in non-secure configuration.  Includes the Device Virtual & Device REST device services and the UI.
    **Make Commands**

    - Use `make run no-secty` and `make down` to start and stop the services using this compose file.
    - Use `make pull no-secty <service(s)>` to pull all or some images for the services in this compose file.

- **docker-compose-no-secty-with-app-sample.yml**
  Contains just the services needed to run in non-secure configuration with Sample application service.  Includes the Device Virtual, Device REST, UI & App Sample services. Use this version when using the UI to make changes to the configurable pipeline on the Sample application service.
  **Make Commands**

  - Use `make run no-secty app-sample` and `make down` to start and stop the services using this compose file.
  - Use `make pull no-secty app-sample <service(s)>` to pull all or some images for the services in this compose file.

- **docker-compose-openziti.yml**
  Contains the services needed to bring OpenZiti online, configure it, and enable consul to perform underlay-based health checking. Used in conjunction with `make run (pull) zero-trust`. This compose file should be started before starting the `make run zero-trust` compose file.

  **Make Commands**

    - Use `make openziti` and `make openziti-down` to start and stop the services using this compose file.
    - Use `make openziti-clean` to remove all stopped containers, all volumes and all networks used by the EdgeX stack. Use this command when needing to do a fresh restart. **Note** You must _also_ run the corresponding `make down zero-trust` command to fully clean up.
    - Use `make openziti-logs` to follow the logs
  
### TAF Compose files

The compose files under the `taf` subfolder are used for the automated TAF tests. These compose files are also generated from `Compose Builder` when the `make build` command is used.

### Additional make commands

- `make clean`

    Runs `down` command and removes all stopped containers, all volumes and all networks used by the EdgeX stack. Use this command when needing to do a fresh restart.
    
- `make get-token`
    For secure mode only. Runs command via docker to generate a new API Gateway token.

### Additional compose files

- **docker-compose-portainer.yml**
    Stand-alone compose file for running Portainer which is a  Docker container management tool. Visit here https://www.portainer.io/ for more details on Portianer.
    Use `make portainer`and `make portainer-down` to start and stop Portainer.

### Use PostgreSQL as the persistence layer in EdgeX
EdgeX services can be configured to use PostgreSQL as the persistence layer. The compose builder now supports generating compose files that use PostgreSQL.

**To use PostgreSQL as the persistence layer, follow these steps**

- Go to `/compose-builder` folder
- `make run no-secty keeper mqtt-bus postgres`

    Runs the services with PostgreSQL as the persistence layer in non-secure mode.
- `make run keeper mqtt-bus postgres`

    Runs the services with PostgreSQL as the persistence layer in secure mode.

> **Note:** `keeper` and `mqtt-bus` are required services for EdgeX to run with PostgreSQL as the persistence layer.
