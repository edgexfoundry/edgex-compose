## Edgex Docker Compose Builder (Odessa)

This folder contains the `Compose Builder` which is made up of **source** compose, **environment** files and a **makefile** for building the single file docker compose file configured for the **Odessa** release. 

### **Note to Developers**: 
> *For **Odessa** patch releases, once you have edited and tested your changes to the source compose files, you **MUST** regenerate the committed **Odessa** compose files using the `make build` command.*
>
> Any options added or removed to/from the `make gen` and `make run` commands must to also be added/removed to/from the new` tui-generator.sh` script
>
> Once the PR is merged, the 4.0 vanity tag must be moved to the latest commit on the `odessa` branch.

### Generating Custom Compose Files

If one of the standard committed `odessa` compose files doesn't meet your needs, you can generate and run a custom `odessa` copmose file using the `make gen <options>` command. 
See [Gen](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-compose/blob/odessa/compose-builder/README.md#gen) and [Run](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-compose/blob/odessa/compose-builder/README.md#run) target details below. 
`Run` simply runs the custom compose file after generating it.

### Compose CLI Command

The Makefile in this folder expects the `docker compose` CLI command to be on the path or it expects you to supply
a valid `docker compose` command by setting `DOCKER_COMPOSE`. The version of `docker compose` must be equal or greater 
than `Docker Compose version v2.24.4`. 

The old stand-alone `docker-compose` tool is no longer supported.
See https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ for installation details for the latest `docker compose` CLI command.

### Generate next release compose files

Do the following to generate the compose files for next release such as `minnesota`

1. Create the new `release` branch from this branch, i.e create the `minnesota` branch (**Now done by DevOps release processes**)
2. Checkout a new working branch from the new `release` branch
3. Update the `REPOSITORY`, `CORE_EDGEX_REPOSITORY` and `APP_SVC_REPOSITORY` (**Now done by DevOps release processes**)
4. Update `versions` contained in the `.env` file appropriately for the new release
5. Run `make build` 
6. Update the two READMEs to be specific to the new `release`
7. Commit changes, open PR and merge PR
8. TAG the new release branch (**Now done by DevOps release processes**)
9. Update EdgeX documentation to refer to the new release branch. (**Now done by DevOps release processes**)

### Generate dot release compose files

1. Checkout a new working branch from the target `release` branch for the dot release, i.e the `jakarta` branch
2. Update the and `versions` contained in the `.env` file appropriately for the dot release
3. Run `make build` 
4. Commit changes, open PR and merge PR
5. TAG the release branch for the dot release (**Now done by DevOps release processes**)

### Multiple Compose files approach

The approach used with these source compose files is the `Extending using multiple Compose files` described here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files

The `Extending using multiple Compose files` approach along with environment files removes the all of the duplication found in earlier EdgeX compose files. This approach makes running the solution more complicated due to having to list the multiple compose files required to run a particular configuration. To alleviate this complexity we provide generated single file compose files one level up. A `Makefile` has been provided here with commands that make it easy to run one of the multiple possible configurations while testing your changes. See the Makefile section below for details on these commands.

> *Note: The `make run`, `make pull` and `make gen` commands all generate a single `docker-compose.yml` file containing the content from the multiple compose files, environment files with all variables resolved for the specified options used. See below for list of options.*

### Environment Files

This folder contains the following environment files:

- **.env**
    This file contains the `version`, `repositories` and image `version` variables referenced in compose files. Docker compose implicitly uses the `.env` file, if it exists, so you will not see it referenced in the compose files. It is referenced in the Makefile so that it can also use these settings.

- **common-non-security.env**
    This file contains the common non-security related environment overrides used by all Edgex services.

- **common-security.env**
    This file contains the common security related environment overrides used by many Edgex services.

- **common-sec-stage-gate.env**
    This file contains the common security-bootstrapper stage gate related environment overrides used by many Edgex services.

### TUI (terminal UI)

Compose builder now has the TUI Generator tool that provides menus to select the options described in the [Makefile](#makefile) section below for generation and running of custom compose files. To use this tool simply run `./tui-generator.sh` in a Linux terminal from the `compose-builder` folder.

### Makefile

This folder contains a `Makefile` that provides commands for building, running, stopping,  generating, cleaning, etc. for the various EdgeX configurations. It is used during **development** of the compose files or generating DEV version for testing service changes.  See the [Gen](#gen) command below for more details on options available to use when generating compose files.

```
Usage: make <target> where target is:
```
#### Portainer

```
portainer       Runs Portainer independent of the EdgeX services.
portainer-down	Stops Portainer independent of the EdgeX services
```
#### Build

```
build
Generates the all standard Edgex compose file variations and the TAF testing compose files. The generated compose files are stored in the top level folder. Each variation of standard compose files includes the Device REST & Device Virtual . Compose files are named appropriately for options used to generate them. TAF compose files are store in the 'taf' sub-folder

Standard compose variations are:
   full secure (docker-compose.yml)
   full secure with app-sample (docker-compose-with-app-sample.yml)
   non-secure (docker-compose-no-secty.yml)
   non-secure with app-sample (docker-compose-no-secty-with-app-sample.yml)
   full secure with zero trust (docker-compose-zero-trust.yml)

 TAF compose variations are:
   full secure general testing (docker-compose-taf.yml)
   non-secure general testing (docker-compose-taf-no-secty.yml)
   full secure perf testing (docker-compose-taf-perf.yml)
